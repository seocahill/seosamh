# About

I'm Seosamh Ó Cathail, (english: Seosamh Cahill) and I come from a small town in the west of Ireland called Ballina.

I became interested in programming through video games and pc games when I a kid, the pre-pentium era PCs 386, 486DX, Monkey Island II LeChuck's revenge ago - fadó.

Near the end of school I got a work placement with a local tech startup called Digitome (now called Propylyon), writing SGML, some basic VB scripting and secretly downloading Doom mods in the morning before the guys got in. I really enjoyed the whole experience so I decided to study Computer Science at NUI Galway.

I studied for a year in Galway before moving up to Dublin, eventually attaining a masters degree in English literature from Trinity College Dublin, following another passion of mine.

Finally I trained professionally to become an accountant and was admitted as a member of the Certified Public Accountants of Ireland in 2004.

I spent the first eight years of my working life as an accountant, I've been a software engineer since 2010 and [I played a bit of music too](https://www.creteboom.com).

In 2011 I left Ireland, living in Canada then Germany before returning home in 2022.

Ich spreche gern Deutsch, un po' di Italiano agus an teanga is áille ar dhroim na talún, an Gaeilge binn blasta.

Seosamh Ó Cathail MA CPA.
